## Hi there, I'm Novemberry! ğŸ‘‹ 
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java on CodeGym. I've already covered its Syntax and Core modules and am now finishing the Multithreading one.
ğŸ‘¯ I haven't yet explored what people collaborate on here, but I'm open to suggestions!
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™d love career advice and general recommendations on what could be done here, in this community.
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about a Java problem! Even if I don't solve it, at least we'll have some fun thinking it through:).
ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her.
âš¡ Fun fact: I love it when it rains in summer.
